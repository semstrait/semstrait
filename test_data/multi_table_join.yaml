# Test fixture for multi-table JOIN within same tableGroup
# 
# Scenario: Two tables (campaign_summary, campaign_details) in the same tableGroup
# with different measures but shared dimensions. This tests the JOIN path when
# a query requires measures from multiple tables.
#
# Tables:
# - campaign_summary: dates[date], campaign[name] -> impressions, clicks
# - campaign_details: dates[date], campaign[name] -> cost, conversions
#
# Query: campaign.name + clicks + cost -> requires JOIN of both tables
